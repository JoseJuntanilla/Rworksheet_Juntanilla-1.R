## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# code here

# 1.There is a built-in vector LETTERS contains the uppercase letters of the alphabet and letters which contains the lowercase letters of the alphabet.

Upper_Alphabet <- LETTERS[1:26]
Upper_Alphabet
Lower_Alphabet <- letters[1:26]
Lower_Alphabet

# 1a.You need to produce a vector that contains the first 11 letters.
First_elev_let <- Upper_Alphabet[1:11]
First_elev_let
First_elev_let2 <- Lower_Alphabet[1:11]
First_elev_let2

# 1b. Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.
Upper_Alphabet <- LETTERS
Odd_num <- Upper_Alphabet[seq(1,length(Upper_Alphabet), by = 2)]
Odd_num
Lower_Alphabet <- letters
Odd_num2 <- Lower_Alphabet[seq(1,length(Lower_Alphabet), by = 2)]
Odd_num2

# 1c. Produce a vector that contains the vowels
