## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# 1.There is a built-in vector LETTERS contains the uppercase letters of the alphabet and letters which contains the lowercase letters of the alphabet.

# 1a.You need to produce a vector that contains the first 11 letters.
First_elev_let <- Upper_Alphabet[1:11]

# 1b. Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.
Upper_Alphabet <- LETTERS
Odd_let <- Upper_Alphabet[seq(1,length(Upper_Alphabet), by = 2)]

# 1c. Produce a vector that contains the vowels
vowels_let <- Upper_Alphabet[c(1,5,9,15,21)]

# Based on the above vector letters:

# 1
Lower_Alphabet <- letters[1:26]

# 1d. Produce a vector that contains the last 5 lowercase letters.

# 1e. Produce a vector that contains letters between 15 to 24 letters in lowercase.

# 2. Create a vector(not a dataframe) with the average temperatures in April for Tugue-garao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban, Samal Island, and Davao City. The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.

# 2a. What is the R code and its result for creating a character vector for the city/town of Tuguegarao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban,Samal Island, and Davao City? Name the object as city. The names should follow the same order as in the instruction.

# 2e. Print the structure by using str() function. Describe the output.
