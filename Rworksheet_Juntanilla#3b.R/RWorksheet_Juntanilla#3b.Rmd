## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# code here

#1. Create a data frame using the table below

#1A.

Household_data_frame <- data.frame(
  Respondents = c(1:20),
  Sex = c("Female","Female","Male","Female","Female","Female","Female","Female","Female","Female","Male","Female","Female","Female","Female","Female","Female","Female","Male","Female"),

#1B. Describe the data. Get the structure or the summary of the data

summary(Household_data_frame)

#1C. Is the mean number of siblings attending is 5?
siblings_mean <- mean(Household_data_frame$Siblings_at_school)
num_of_mean <- siblings_mean == 5
print(num_of_mean)

#No because the mean is 2.95

#1D. Extract the 1st two rows and then all the columns using the subsetting functions.Write the codes and its output.
two_rows_in_col <- Household_data_frame[1:2, ]
print(two_rows_in_col)

#1E. Extract 3rd and 5th row with 2nd and 4th column. Write the codes and its result.
combined_col <- Household_data_frame[c(3, 5), c(2, 4)]

#1F. Select the variable types of houses then store the vector that results as types_houses.Write the codes.

#1G. Select only all Males respondent that their father occupation was farmer. Write the codes and its output.

#1H. Select only all females respondent that have greater than or equal to 5 number of siblings attending school. Write the codes and its outputs.Select only all females respondent that have greater than or equal to 5 number of siblings attending school. Write the codes and its outputs.

#2. Write a R program to create an empty data frame. Using the following codes:
df <- data.frame(
  Ints = integer(0),
  Doubles = double(0),
  Characters = character(0),
  Logicals = logical(0),
  Factors = factor(NA, levels = character(0)),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

print("Structure of the empty dataframe:")
str(df)

#2a. The data frame is empty

#3. Create a .csv file of this. Save it as HouseholdData.csv

#3a. Import the csv file into the R environment. Write the codes.

imported_data$Typeshouse <- factor(imported_data$Typeshouse, levels = c("Wood", "Concrete", "Semi-Concrete"))
imported_data$Typeshouse <- as.integer(imported_data$Typeshouse)

#3d. On fatherâ€™s occupation, factor it as Farmer = 1; Driver = 2; and Others = 3. What is the R code and its output?
imported_data$FatherOccupation <- factor(imported_data$FatherOccupation, levels = c("Farmer", "Driver", "Others"))

#4. Interpret the graph

# The graph in figure 3 represents the sentiments of people every day that has a major impact on our world everytime. In short, we always allow ourselves to show our opinions and our knowledge that we learn in a all day basis.
